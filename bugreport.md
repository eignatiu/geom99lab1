The basemap didn't seem to work properly - in its entireity.
arcgis/topographic - as copied from the template did not work

arcgis-topographic - loaded the relief features without any labeling
arcgis-imagery - same case - loaded imagery without any labels
also tried many other basemaps, but kept getting almost the same error
